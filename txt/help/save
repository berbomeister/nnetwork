    Save:

    Use "save modelname"

    Saves the currently loaded model as modelname. If no model is
    loaded the command is ignored. If a model with the same name  already
    existed, it is overwritten.

    Example:
    >>load fastnet1
    Model successfully loaded
    >>save fastnet1_test
    Model successfully saved
