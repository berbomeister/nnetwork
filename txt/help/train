    Train:

    Use "train optim epochs"

    Trains the current model, using the optim, for specified epochs.
    If no model has been loaded, the command is ignored. Currently supports
    Adam and SGD optimizer with default values. learning_rate for optimizers
    is dependant on train epoch, using the method learning_rate(epoch).

    Example:
    >>load fastnet1
    Model successfully loaded
    >>train adam 1
    epoch:    1 test acc: 45.21%
    Finished Training! Maybe test accuracy now?
    >>accuracy
    The accuracy of the current model is 45.21%
