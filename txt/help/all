    Available commands are:
    construct                       opens command interface to create a new neural network
    load [modelname]                loads an existing model with the specified name, if such exists
    save [modelname]                saves the current loaded as a new model with the specified name, or updates an existing model
    predict imagefile               uses the current model to predict contents of the image(using the cifar-10 classes)
    accuracy                        prints out the current model's accuracy, tested on the cifar-10 test batch
    train [optimizer] [n_epochs]    trains the model on the cifar-10 corpus, using the specified optimizer for n epochs 
    view                            show pipeline of current model
    exit                            exits the program
